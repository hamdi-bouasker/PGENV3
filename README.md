## _Password Generator_

It generates random unique passwords each time composed of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits and special characters.


## _File(s) Encryptor_

The files are encrypted using AES algorythm.

The main feature is that the user is able to decrypt the file by cliking on it and insert the password at the prompt which makes it great feature when you want to send an encrypted file to someone by email because the receiver does not need the software to decrypt it.

The ecnryption and decryption of bulk files are done using **_async / await Tasks_** to save the UI from freezing and to offer smooth process.

## _Supported File Version_

- Word 2019 and above
- Excel 2019 and above

You can compile the code in Visual Studio but you will need to insert syncfusion license key in **_Program.cs_** file or download the provided installer. 

Windows will warns you to not install it but that warning is due the software is not signed with a digital certificate which should be purchased from commercial authority with the minimum of $260 yearly.
